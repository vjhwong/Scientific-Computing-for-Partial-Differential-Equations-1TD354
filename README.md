# Scientific-Computing-for-Partial-Differential-Equations-1TD354
The main focus of the course is on mathematical modeling with partial differential equations and numerical solution methods. Different types of well-posed boundary conditions. Analysis and implementation of numerical methods based on finite difference methods and finite element methods. The course contains the energy method, normalized vector spaces and iterative methods for solving linear systems of equations. The methods above are treated with regard to theory, practice, implementation and verification. Examples of key concepts included in the course include well-poseness, verification, accuracy, efficiency, stability and convergence.

NOTE:
The scripts in the Labs are not written by me but were provided by the course. I have uploaded them here
just to display what type of material was covered in the course.
